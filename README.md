This app comes from my love of quotes, stories and ideas.

## MVP Goals/Stretch Goals/What's Next
- I would like to add onto the functionality and provide a favorites option so the user can perform CRUD operations on those items.
- I would like to add the author's image and a brief bio about them when their quote appears so their words come to life.
- I would like to add a user/pass so the user can conveniently go back to the app and see their selections.
- I would like to add onto the Frontend Design.
